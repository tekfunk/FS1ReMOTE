# FS1ReMOTE
For use with a Yamaha FS1R, Ableton Live, and a Mac.  Made in Max.

I am attempting to build a suite of tools for my FS1R which sits in a rack not too accessable from my seat.  I have a Mac, use Live and what's available is lacking.

Phase One will be a Max for Live device (FS1R Live)  and a OS X app (FS1R Edit).  

FS1R Live allows you to choose your Peformance, and has 20 control knobs.  This one is all midi cc and works well with the Ableton Push display. It is currently usable and the amxd is included in the build folder. The next thing i'll be doing to this is getting it to read the parameter values of the controllers that actually edit the Peformance (Attack, Release, Formant, FM, etc).

FS1R Edit is a OS X built in Max. It is a editor that uses sysex to choose and edit all Peformance parameters. Currently it loads the current performace from the FS1R and fills some of that info in my GUI but that's about it.  I will continue to plug away at it.  No build yet on this one.
